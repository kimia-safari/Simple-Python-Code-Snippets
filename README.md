## Scripts

### 1. BMI Calculator

#### Overview
The BMI Calculator script calculates Body Mass Index (BMI) based on user-provided height and weight inputs. BMI is a measure of body fat and is commonly used to classify individuals into different weight categories.

#### Instructions
1. Run the script by executing the command: `python bmi_calculator.py`.
2. Enter your height when prompted (in meters).
3. Enter your weight when prompted (in kilograms).

#### Output
The script will calculate your BMI and provide feedback on your weight category.

#### BMI Categories
- **Underweight:** BMI < 18.5
- **Normal Weight:** 18.5 <= BMI < 25
- **Slightly Overweight:** 25 <= BMI < 30
- **Obese:** 30 <= BMI < 35
- **Clinically Obese:** BMI >= 35

#### Example
```bash
$ python bmi_calculator.py
Enter your height in meters (e.g., 1.75): 1.75
Enter your weight in kilograms (e.g., 72): 65
Your BMI is 21.22, you have a normal weight.
